#**Germany Pharma Sales Decline Analysis (2017–2020)**

This project analyzes Germany’s pharma market performance using a hypothesis-driven diagnostic approach. The goal is to identify the key drivers behind a 7.9% YoY sales decline in 2020, using segmentation across product classes, distributors, sales teams, and monthly trends.

**Key Outcomes**

Built an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize trends and performance.

Conducted a multi-level root-cause analysis uncovering:

**Analgesics collapse (−$151M)**

**Major distributor disruptions (Bashirian −98%, Koss/Kozey −10–18%)**

**Sales-team impact, mainly Delta (−$126M) and Charlie (−$77M)**

Generated actionable insights for commercial decisions.
